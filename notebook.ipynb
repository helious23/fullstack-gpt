He is strong and wants to be liked, but there is a harsh and defiant wistfulness about him. He is a member of the Senior Society and seems to approve of the narrator. He owns a nice place with a sunken Italian garden and a motor boat. Inside his house, there is a bright and rosy-colored space with French windows. The room is filled with movement, from the breeze blowing through the curtains to the rippling of the wine-colored rug. Tom shuts the windows, bringing stillness to the room.
